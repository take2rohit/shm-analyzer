# Damped Simple Harmonic Motion analyzer

## Working 
  
  A video is selected to analyze its motion. Proper colour thresholding is done to identify the object and its centroid location is    obtained. Every coordinate of centroid is stored and later its extrumum are calculated. all vales are stored then in a csv file. Using elematry mathematics and retrived data, equation of motion is calculated.

## Software
  Matlab R2015a for image processing
